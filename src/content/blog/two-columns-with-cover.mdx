This is a two columns layout with a cover image. The cover image is set in the frontmatter of the markdown file.

The cover image is displayed on the top of the page, and the content is displayed in two columns.

The cover image is responsive and will adapt to the screen size.

To use it, set the `postLayout` frontmatter to `column` and add a `cover` field with the path to the image. Or leave `postLayout` empty and add a `cover` field with the path to the image.
